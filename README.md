# Symptom tracking and diet effects


## Project description

This project was started as a way to help identify and tracking how dietary symptoms might be affected by diet, specficially for those with dietary sensitivities or other chronic conditions.

By combining food and symptom logging with model approaches, this is a simple tool kit for understanding how changes in diet can effect short-term health outcomes.

Hopefully, this will find use as a way for individuals to be mindful of the effects of foods and supplements on their well-being and encourage careful, safe, and exciting exploration of food!
